Private and public keys have to always match. If you are accessing a machin then use the keys of 
that machine to match the remote machine or else you will get access denied.


Install Jenkins Master

**********
Configure Jenkins Master Credentials
-On the Jenkins master server, login to the Jenkins user and generate the ssh key.
su - jenkins
ssh-keygen
-And you will get the 'id_rsa' private and 'id_rsa.pub' public key in the '.ssh' directory.
-Open your Jenkins dashboard and click on the 'Credentials' menu on the left.
-And click the 'global' domain link.
-Now click 'Add Credentials'.
-Now choose the authentication method.
Kind: SSH Username with private key
Scope: Global
Username: jenkins
Private key: Enter directly and paste the 'id_rsa' private key of Jenkins user from the master server.
-And the Jenkins credential with ssh auth key method have been created.
**********

Set up Slave Nodes
**********
Now we will setup slave nodes server by installing java on those server, and create a new Jenkins user.

Install Java
***********
-Install the 'software-properties-common' packages and add the java PPA repository.
sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa -y
-Now install java OpenJDK using apt command below.
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y
-After the installation is complete, check the installed java version.
java -version
-And you will get Java OpenJDK 1.8 installed on the system.
**********
Delete User
***********
sudo deluser --remove-home ${User}
***********

Add New Jenkins User
************
-Now add the 'Jenkins' user to all agent nodes.
useradd -m -s /bin/bash jenkins
update password => sudo passwd jenkins


Copy the SSH Key from Master to Slave
*************
****If you created droplet with password****
Next, we need to upload the key 'id_rsa.pub' from the master to slave server nodes. We need to upload to 
each server nodes using 'ssh-copy-id' command as below.
ssh-copy-id jenkins@10.0.15.22

****If you created droplet with sshKey****
-On your local machine, output the contents of your public key.
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the output.
Log in to your Droplet using your local terminal and 
create the ~/.ssh directory if it does not already exist:
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
-You'll need to add your SSH key to an authorized_keys file in this directory. The public keys listed in that file are the ones that can be used to log in to the server as this user.

Create and open the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for editing using a terminal-based text editor, like nano.
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-Make sure the permissions and ownership of the files are correct.
chmod -R go= ~/.ssh
chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.ssh
-You can now log out of your Droplet. The next time you log in, you can do so without a password.

Add New Slave Nodes
***********
On the Jenkins dashboard, click the 'Manage Jenkins' menu, and click 'Manage Nodes'.
Click the 'New Node'.
Type the node name 'slave01', choose the 'permanent agent', and click 'OK'.
-Now type node information details.
Description: slave01 node agent server
Remote root directory: /home/jenkins
Labels: slave01
Launch method: Launch slave agent via SSH, type the host ip address '10.0.15.21', 
choose the authentication using 'Jenkins' credential.
-Now click 'Save' button and wait for the master server to connect to all agent nodes and launch the agent services.
